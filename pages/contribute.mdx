## Writing Problems
To write a problem, you can use the `<Problem/>` component in an `.mdx` file as follows:



```jsx
<Problem
      title="Sample Math Problem"
      difficulty={3} // Renders as üê± for moderate difficulty
      relevance={4}
      source="Example Source"
      link="https://example.com"
  >
  <div label="question">
      What is the value of $x$ in the equation $x^2 + 4x - 5 = 0$?
  </div>
  <div label="hint">
    Try factoring the equation into two binomials.
  </div>
  <div label="answer">
    The value of $x$ is either $-5$ or $1$.
  </div>
  <div label="takeaway">
    Factoring quadratic equations can simplify the process of finding solutions.
    </div>
</Problem>
```
<Problem
      title="Glasklar Problem"
      difficulty={3} 
      relevance={4} 
      source="Example Source"
      link="https://example.com"

### Props

#### `title`
- **Type**: `string` (required)
- **Description**: The title of the problem, displayed prominently at the top of the component.

#### `difficulty`
- **Type**: `number` (optional)
- **Description**: Represents the difficulty level of the problem. Accepts an integer from `1` to `5`, which displays as an animal emoji to provide a visual indicator of difficulty:
  - 1 üê£ (Easy)
  - 2 üê¢ (Fairly Easy)
  - 3 üê± (Moderate)
  - 4 üê∫ (Hard)
  - 5 ü¶Å (Very Hard)
  - 6 üêâ (Hmmm?)

#### `relevance`
- **Type**: `number` (optional)
- **Description**: Represents the relevance or importance of the problem. Accepts a number, displayed as repeated `üéì` emoji to visually convey the relevance level for the course. Use a scale of 0-4. The number 0 will render as `ü™©`, meant for fun but not really relevant exercises :). 

#### `source`
- **Type**: `string` (optional)
- **Description**: The source of the problem, such as a textbook, website, or other reference material. Displays next to the problem if provided.

#### `link`
- **Type**: `string` (optional)
- **Description**: URL link for the problem source. If `link` is provided along with `source`, the source will be displayed as a clickable link in a custom color.


### Children

The possible types for labels are `question`, `answer`, `hint`, and `takeaway`.

The order of the elements you pass as children to the component matters only within the same label type. For example, the first hint will be labeled as *Hint 1*, the second as *Hint 2*, and so on. However, the overall order of the labels will always follow the sequence: *question, hint, answer, takeaway*. This ensures a consistent structure for the problem presentation.

Additionally, you can have multiple questions, answers, hints or takeaways. The numbering will apply only when there are multiple elements of the same type, such as multiple questions or multiple hints.
