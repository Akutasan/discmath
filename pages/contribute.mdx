## Writing Problems
To write a problem, you can use the `<Problem/>` component in an `.mdx` file as follows:



```jsx
<Problem title="Problem 1" source="ChatGPT" link="https://chatgpt.com">
      <div label="question">What is $2 + 2$?</div>
      <div label="hint">Think about basic arithmetic.</div>
      <div label="hint">Think again!</div>
      <div label="answer">The answer is $4$.</div>
      <div label="takeaway">Basic arithmetic is fundamental.</div>
      <div label="takeaway">It is important!</div>
</Problem>
```
<Problem title="Problem 1" source="ChatGPT" link="https://chatgpt.com">
  <div label="question">What is $2 + 2$?</div>
      <div label="hint">Think about basic arithmetic.</div>
       <div label="hint">Think again!</div>
      <div label="answer">The answer is $4$.</div>
      <div label="takeaway">Basic arithmetic is fundamental.</div>
      <div label="takeaway">It is important!</div>
</Problem>

The `source` and `link` parameters are optional. You can provide just the `source` parameter, which should be your name if you are setting up your own problem.

The possible types for labels are `question`, `answer`, `hint`, and `takeaway`.

The order of the elements you pass as children to the component matters only within the same label type. For example, the first hint will be labeled as *Hint 1*, the second as *Hint 2*, and so on. However, the overall order of the labels will always follow the sequence: *question, hint, answer, takeaway*. This ensures a consistent structure for the problem presentation.

Additionally, you can have multiple questions, answers, hints or takeaways. The numbering will apply only when there are multiple elements of the same type, such as multiple questions or multiple hints.
