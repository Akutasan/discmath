<Problem title="Equivalence Relation on Vector Spaces" source="Tobias Steinbrecher">
  <div label="question">
    Let $V$ be a real vector space, and define a relation $\sim$ on $V$ as follows: For $u, v \in V$, we say $u \sim v$ if and only if $u - v \in W$, where $W$ is a subspace of $V$. Prove that this relation is an equivalence relation.
  </div>
  <div label="hint">
    To prove that $R$ is an equivalence relation, you need to verify that it satisfies the three properties of equivalence relations: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. For reflexivity, consider $u - u$. For symmetry, think about how $u - v$ relates to $v - u$. For transitivity, check how the condition $u - v \in W$ and $v - w \in W$ combine.

  <div label="answer">
    We need to prove that the relation $u \sim v$ (i.e., $u - v \in W$) is an equivalence relation. This requires verifying three properties: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity.

    **1. Reflexivity**:  
    For any $u \in V$, we have:
    $$
    u - u = 0
    $$
    Since $W$ is a subspace, $0 \in W$. Therefore, $u \sim u$, and the relation is reflexive.

    **2. Symmetry**:  
    Suppose $u \sim v$, which means $u - v \in W$. We need to show that $v \sim u$. Since $u - v \in W$ and $W$ is a subspace, we know that $-(u - v) = v - u \in W$ (because subspaces are closed under scalar multiplication by $-1$). Therefore, $v \sim u$, and the relation is symmetric.

    **3. Transitivity**:  
    Suppose $u \sim v$ and $v \sim w$, meaning $u - v \in W$ and $v - w \in W$. We need to show that $u \sim w$. Since $W$ is a subspace and is closed under addition, we have:
    $$
    (u - v) + (v - w) = u - w \in W
    $$
    Therefore, $u \sim w$, and the relation is transitive.

    Since the relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, $\sim$ is an equivalence relation.
