<Problem title="Equivalence Relation on Vector Spaces" source="Tobias Steinbrecher">
  <div label="question">
    Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $F$, and define a relation $\sim$ on $V$ as follows: For $u, v \in V$, we say $u \sim v$ if and only if $u - v \in W$, where $W$ is a subspace of $V$. Prove that this relation is an equivalence relation.
