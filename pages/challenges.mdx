<Problem title="Equivalence Relation on Vector Spaces" source="Tobias Steinbrecher">
  <div label="question">
    Let $V$ be a real vector space, and define a relation $\sim$ on $V$ as follows: For $u, v \in V$, we say $u \sim v$ if and only if $u - v \in W$, where $W$ is a subspace of $V$. Prove that this relation is an equivalence relation.
  </div>
  <div label="hint">
    To prove that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation, you need to verify that it satisfies the three properties of equivalence relations: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. For reflexivity, consider $u - u$. For symmetry, think about how $u - v$ relates to $v - u$. For transitivity, check how the condition $u - v \in W$ and $v - w \in W$ combine.

  <div label="answer">
    We need to prove that the relation $u \sim v$ (i.e., $u - v \in W$) is an equivalence relation. This requires verifying three properties: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity.

    **1. Reflexivity**:  
    For any $u \in V$, we have:
    $$
    u - u = 0
    $$
    Since $W$ is a subspace, $0 \in W$. Therefore, $u \sim u$, and the relation is reflexive.

    **2. Symmetry**:  
    Suppose $u \sim v$, which means $u - v \in W$. We need to show that $v \sim u$. Since $u - v \in W$ and $W$ is a subspace, we know that $-(u - v) = v - u \in W$ (because subspaces are closed under scalar multiplication by $-1$). Therefore, $v \sim u$, and the relation is symmetric.

    **3. Transitivity**:  
    Suppose $u \sim v$ and $v \sim w$, meaning $u - v \in W$ and $v - w \in W$. We need to show that $u \sim w$. Since $W$ is a subspace and is closed under addition, we have:
    $$
    (u - v) + (v - w) = u - w \in W
    $$
    Therefore, $u \sim w$, and the relation is transitive.

    Since the relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, $\sim$ is an equivalence relation.

<Problem title="Two be or not two be" source="Yannick Funke, Max Obreiter">
    <div label="question">
        *Prove the following statement*:
        $$
            \left| \left(\mathbb N / \equiv_2 \right) \right| = 2
        $$

        You are **NOT** allowed to use:
        - Proof by Induction
        - Results from Chapter 4 and 5 unless explicitely allowed

        Assume the following:
        - The universe is $U = \mathbb Z$
        - The binary functions $\cdot, +, -$ and the unary function $-$ are defined as usual. You can also use the properties of these functions (e.g. distributivity, etc.).
        - The predicates $\le$ and $=$ are defined as usual. You can also use the properties of the combination of these predicates and the functions (e.g. the order axioms).
        - $(\mathbb N; \le)$ is well-ordered
        - $a \equiv_2 b \overset{\small def}{\Longleftrightarrow} \exists k (2k = a - b)$

<Problem title="Counting the Uncountable" source="Yannick Funke">
    <div label="question">
        Let $B$ be an arbitrary but fixed set. We then define $Q$ as:
        $$
            Q = \left\{ (A, f) \in \left( \mathcal P(B) \times \mathcal P(B)^{\mathcal P(B)} \right) \; \vert \; f \in A^A \land A \preceq \mathbb N \land A \not\sim \mathbb N \right\}
        $$
        (If this "arbitrary" $B$ looks scary, you can assume that $Q$ contains all elements of the form $(A, f \in A^A)$ where $A$ is finite. Note that this set is not defined though.)
        
        We define $\sim$ on $Q$ as:
        $$
            (A_1, f_1) \sim (A_2, f_2) \overset{\text{\small def}}{\iff}\text{ there exists a bijection $g: A_1 \to A_2$, such that: }f_1 = g^{-1} \circ f_2 \circ g
        $$
        
        Prove that $Q$ is an equivalence relation (for a fixed $B$). Then prove that $(Q/\sim)$ is countable (for a fixed $B$).
