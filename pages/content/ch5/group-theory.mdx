# Group theory

Group theory is a super interesting area - the astonishing fact is that the same mathematical structure appears in totally different fields from cryptography to quantum mechnics.\\

We will show that this proof pattern is **not sound** using propositional logic.
Let $A$ be the propositional symbol which corresponds to the truth value of the mathematical statment $T$ and $B,C$ be the propositional symbols with which we *model* the mathematical statment $S$ and $R$ respectively. Now proving that $S \implies R$ is true, corresponds to the formula $B \to C$ being true and proving $(\text{not } T) \implies (S \text{ or } R)$ translates to the formula $\lnot A \to (B \lor C)$ being true.

For our proof pattern to be sound we therefore need

$$
(B \to C) \land (\lnot A \to (B \lor C)) \vDash A
$$

to hold.

But now, we can apply our skills from propositional logic. We can either draw a truth table or see that this is not the case. Consider the assignment $A = 0$, $C = 1$ and $B$ to whatever we want. Then we obtain that the right-hand side is false, while the left-hand side is true (verify this as an exercise).
