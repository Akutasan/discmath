# Group Theory

Group theory is a fascinating area of mathematics. It reveals deep connections between seemingly unrelated fields, from cryptography to quantum mechanics. The concept of a "group" provides a unifying framework to study symmetry and structure.

The most central definition is the definition of a group:

<Callout type='def'>
**Definition 5.7:** 
A *group* is an algebra $\langle G; *, \hat{}, e \rangle$, where:
1. **Associativity**: For all $a, b, c \in G$, $(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)$.
2. **Identity Element**: There exists an $e \in G$ such that for all $a \in G$, $a * e = e * a = a$.
3. **Inverse Element**: For each $a \in G$, there exists $b \in G$ such that $a * b = b * a = e$.

Note that we assume that $* : G \times G \to G$, thus we have closure.
</Callout>

Note that these axioms are not **minimal** (i.e. for example the property that not only $a * e = a$ but also $e * a = a$ is implied by the rest of the  ).

## Theory \& Intuition

### Direct Product of Groups

<Callout type='definition'>
**Definition 5.9:** The **direct product** of $n$ groups $\langle G_1; *_1 \rangle, \dots, \langle G_n; *_n \rangle$ is the algebra:

$$
\langle G_1 \times \cdots \times G_n; \star \rangle,
$$

where the operation $\star$ is defined component-wise:

$$
(a_1, \dots, a_n) \star (b_1, \dots, b_n) = (a_1 *_1 b_1, \dots, a_n *_n b_n).
$$
</Callout>

<Callout type='lemma'>
**Lemma 5.4:** $\langle G_1 \times \cdots \times G_n; \star \rangle$ is a group, where the neutral element and the inversion operation are defined component-wise in the respective groups.
</Callout>

Why are these product groups interesting? Well, as we will see in the following subsection, the notion of an isomorphism provides a way to sort of say *two groups have the same structure*. In that sense, being able to find an *equivalent form* written as a direct product of smaller groups, can be very helpful.

### Homomorphisms \& Isomorphisms
<Callout type='definition'>
**Definition 5.10:** For two groups $\langle G; *, \hat{}, e \rangle$ and $\langle H; \star, \tilde{}, e' \rangle$, a function $\psi : G \to H$ is called a **group homomorphism** if, for all $a, b \in G$:

$$
\psi(a * b) = \psi(a) \star \psi(b).
$$

If $\psi$ is a bijection from $G$ to $H$, then it is called an **isomorphism**, and we say that $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic and write $G \simeq H$.
</Callout>

What does this actually mean? It sort of means, that it does not matter if we apply the map $\psi$ first and compute the group operation $\star$ (in $H$) and **then** look at the result in $H$ or if we compute the product $*$ (in $G$) and the apply the homomorphism $\psi$ and look at the output in $H$. Both ways yield the same result if the equation above holds. So one could intuitively say the *role* of an element $a$ when computing the group operation with some other element $b$ in $G$, is preserved through the mapping $\psi$. While this observation and description is very imprecise, the following section should make the intuition behind this kind of preservation clear. The little property from above actually lets us derive more nice properties of $\psi$. Namely:

<Callout type='lemma'>
**Lemma 5.5:** A group homomorphism $\psi$ from $\langle G; *, \hat{}, e \rangle$ to $\langle H; \star, \tilde{}, e' \rangle$ satisfies:

1. $\psi(e) = e'$,  
2. $\psi(\hat{a}) = \tilde{\psi(a)}$ for all $a \in G$.
</Callout>


### Intuition about Homomorphisms

Why does a homomorphism map the neutral element in $G$ to the neutral element in $H$? Well, this is exactly what we would expect intuitively. The neutral element in a group is like "doing nothing" to an element - it's the identity operation. If we apply $\psi$ after $e \in G$ has acted on $a \in G$, it should produce the same result as letting $\psi$ map $a$ first and then applying $e' \in H$.

But here's something interesting: does every homomorphism have to be injective? No! For instance, consider an extreme case where the entire group $G$ maps to just the neutral element $e' \in H$. This mapping satisfies the homomorphism property because applying the neutral element under any group operation still respects the structure.

A nice way to think of this is like projecting a 3D object onto a flat surface: the object's details might be lost, but the structure of relationships between points can still hold.




To gain intuition about homomorphisms, I think the following image is incredible helpful:

**So what's going on in this picture?** First of all we have to clarify some naming and notation:

1. $h : G \to H$ is a **homomorphism** in this picture
2. $\ker h$ is the so-called **kernel** of the map $h$. This is simply the set of all elements which map to the neutral element. You might of heard of the concept of **kernel** or *null-space* in linear algebra. The concept is totally related - for every linear map (or more concretely matrix), there is some set of elements in the domain, which maps to $0$ in the codomain. So in our case it is simply consider the following set:
$$
\ker h = \{a \in G \mid h(g) = 1_H\}
$$ 
So as you can see in the picture and as pointed out before, there can be more than one element in the kernel. We could actually have the case that $\ker h = G$.

3. $\text{im} h$ is the so-called **image** of the map $h$. Again you might have heared about a concept like this in linear algebra. It is simply the set of all elements we can possibly get as an output√ñ
$$
\text{im} h = \{h(a) \mid a \in G\}
$$

4. The set $a N$ is a so-called **coset**. This concept is not explicity stated in this course, but super useful when you explore more properties. You will find more about it in the [Cosets](#cosets) section. We defined $N = \ker h$ (i.e. all elements in $G$ which map to $1_H$). Now for an arbitrary element $a \in G$, we can define: 
$$ 
a N = \{a *_G g \mid g \in N\}
$$ 
So what we are doing here is we simply take an element and *multiply it* (in the sense of the group operation in $G$) to all elements which are in $N$ and make a set of all the outputs. We can do this for in arbitary $N \subseteq G$, however in this case we choose $\ker h$. 

**What is interesting about this picture?**

1. The kernel forms the foundation of symmetry in $G$ - all elements in the kernel behave indistinguishably under $h$.
2. We can sort of see at least in the picture (there is no reason why we should expect/believe this intuitively in the first place!) that there are some sort of *classes* of elements (e.g. $a N$) which map all to the same value $h(a)$. These can be build from these ominous construction we called cosets. There is no reason to believe that this is actually true... well there is - after we proved interesting properties which are more investigated below - also take a look at the exercsies.
3. <span className="relative group inline-block"><span className="block px-2 py-1 bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-800 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 rounded-md cursor-pointer">Think about what would happen in the picture above if $h$ was injective! (*hover to reveal*)</span><span className="absolute z-10 left-0 mt-2 hidden w-max px-4 py-2 bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-900 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 rounded-md shadow-lg group-hover:block"><div className="whitespace-normal break-words max-w-xs overflow-hidden">If $h$ was injective, then there would not be two different elements in $G$ which map to the same element in $H$. So we sort of would need the group $H$ to be at least as big (restricting ourselves to finite groups). Actually, even we haven't defined the notion of subgroups yet, we could actually show that $\im h$ is a subgroup of $H$. The intuition here is that we can sort of not *escape* $\im h$ by *multiplying* with elements in $\im h$. If we could, we could show that we could also reach this element by applying $h$ to some element in $G$ (by the properties of the homomorphism $h$) We will formulate these [Additional properties](#additional-properties)</div></span></span>

There are so many more connections here which 
Let's try to look at a specific example to get a better grasp for what we did until now.

With this deeper understanding, try exploring homomorphisms in different contexts - like how polynomials, matrices, or symmetry groups map to each other. **It's all connected!**

#### Intuition of Isomorphisms

Then what is the additionaly property we obtain from an **isomorphism** (i.e. additional bijectivity)? From the chapter on functions, you should know that bijectivity gives us a sense




#### Additional Properties


### Subgroups


### Order

### Cyclic Groups

### Lagrange Theorem

Lagrange's Theorem states:

> If $G$ is a finite group and $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, then the order (number of elements) of $H$ divides the order of $G$.

#### Proof
1. Partition $G$ into disjoint left cosets of $H$.
2. Each coset has exactly $|H|$ elements.
3. The number of cosets, denoted $[G : H]$, satisfies $|G| = |H| \cdot [G : H]$.
4. Hence, $|H|$ divides $|G|$.
