<Problem title="Alternative Solution Bonus 9a" source="Max Obreiter">
    <div label="question">
        Let $\langle R; +, -, 0, \cdot, 1 \rangle$ be an integral domain; $a, b \in R$ and $n, m \in \mathbb N$. We then define condition $(1)$:
        $$
            \begin{aligned}
                0 < m \le n \land \gcd(m, n) = 1 \land a^m = b^m \land a^n = b^n && (1)
            \end{aligned}
        $$
        Prove that if $(1)$ is satisfied, we have $a = b$.

        Show it without using the fact that there exist $x, y \in \mathbb Z$ s.t. $xm + yn = 1$ holds.

        Show it using a contradiction proof!
    </div>
    <div label="hint">
        Assume that $n$ is minimal, then derive a contradiction.
    </div>
    <div label="answer">
        Note that we already assumed that $m \le n$.

        Assume that this statement was false. Then there must exist a smallest $n$, such that $(1)$ holds but $a \ne b$. We now show that this $n$ can't exist:

        If $m = n$, then by $\gcd(m, n) = 1$, we know that $m = n = 1$ and we get $a = a^1 = b^1 = b$ which is a contradiction to $a \ne b$.

        So assume $0 < m < n$. We then know:
        $$
            \begin{aligned}
                && a^n &= b^n \\
                & \dot\iff & a^m \cdot a^{n - m} &= b^m \cdot b^{n - m} && \text{Def. $r^k$} \\
                & \dot\iff & a^m \cdot a^{n - m} &= a^m \cdot b^{n - m} && a^m = b^m \\
                & \dot\iff & a^m \cdot a^{n - m} - a^m \cdot b^{n - m} &= 0 && -a^m \cdot b^{n - m} \\
                & \dot\iff & a^m \cdot (a^{n - m} - b^{n - m}) &= 0 && \text{Distr. Law}
            \end{aligned}
        $$

        Now we distinguish two cases (either term must be zero because $R$ is an integral domain).

        If $a^m = 0$, then we must have $a = 0 = b^m = b$ (since $R$ has no zerodivisors); a contradiction to $a \ne b$.

        So $a^m \ne 0$, but this means that:
        $$
            \begin{aligned}
                && a^{n - m} - b^{n - m} &= 0 \\
                &\dot\iff & a^{n - m} &= b^{n - m}
            \end{aligned}
        $$

        Since $0 < m < n$ we have $0 < n - m < n$ and $m < n$. Now we can define $m'$ and $n'$:
        $$
            m' = \min(n - m, m) \\ n' = \max(n - m, m)
        $$
        Note that $0 < m' \le n' < n$.

        By Lemma 4.2 we have $\gcd(n, n - m) = gcd(n, m) = 1$. This means that $m'$ and $n'$ satisfy $(1)$.

        And by assumption $a \ne b$; but $n' < n$, which is a contradiction to the assumption that $n$ was minimal!

        Since there is no minimal $n$ for which the statement does not hold, it must hold for all $n$.

        <Callout type="info">
            If we instead continued with $(m', n')$ and continued to apply these steps, we would reach $(1, 1)$, since we are essentially running euclids algorithm in the exponent!

<Problem title="MGO" source="Philipp Barski, Yannick Funke">
    <div label="question">
    What is the order of $\mathrm{GF}(p)[x]_{x^m}^*$? Prove your answer.
    </div>
    <div label="hint">
        Use the fact that $\mathrm{GF}(p)[x]_{x^m}^* = \{ a \in \mathrm{GF}(p)[x]_{x^m} \mid \gcd(a, x^m)=1 \}$.
    </div>
    <div label="hint">
        Show that $\gcd(a, x^m) \neq 1 \implies x | a$.
    </div>
    <div label="hint">
        Every polynomial in $\mathrm{GF}(p)[x]$ can be factored uniquely into irreducible polynomials up to taking associates (constant factors).
    </div>
    <div label="answer">
        Define $R = \mathrm{GF}(p)[x]_{x^m}$. Let $a, g \in R$.

        $\gcd(a, x^m) = g \neq 1 \implies g | x^m$.
        Note that we refer to the devision relation on $\mathrm{GF}(p)[x]$ here.
        From Theorem 5.27 we know
        that every element in $\mathrm{GF}(p)[x]$ can be factored uniquely into irreducible polynomials.
        Clearly this factorization consists only of factors of the form $x$ since
        $x$ is of degree 1 and therefore irreducible.
        Since $g$ isn't constant, there exists an irreducible polynomial
         $h \in \mathrm{GF}(p)[x]$
        s.t. $h | g$. Since $g | x^m$ we have $h | x^m$ and therefore $h$ must be
        a factor in the unique polynomial factorization of $x^m$.
        By contradiction $h = x$ and therefore $x | g$.

        For the other direction we have $x | a \implies x | \gcd(a, x^m) \implies \gcd(a, x^m) \neq 1$.
        Using Lemma 5.36 we find $R^* = \{ a \in R \mid \gcd(a, x^m)=1 \} = \{ a \in R \mid x \nmid a \}$.

        Now we determine the order of
        $$
        \begin{aligned}
        \{ a \in R \mid x | a \} &= \{ xb \mid b \in R \land xb \in R \setminus \{0\} \} \\
        &= \{ xb \mid b \in R \land 0 \leq \mathrm{deg}(b) \lt m - 1 \}
        \end{aligned}
        $$

        The last equalitiy holds since in an integral $deg(xb) = deg(x) + deg(b) = 1 + deg(b)$.
        Since GF(p) is a field, it is also an integral domain and so is $\mathrm{GF}(p)[x]$.
        Therefore
        $$
        \begin{aligned}
        \left| \mathrm{GF}(p)[x]_{x^m}^*\right| &= \left| R \setminus \{0\} \setminus \{ xb \mid b \in R \land 0 \leq \mathrm{deg}(b) \lt m - 1 \} \right| \\
        &= p^m - 1 - (p^{m-1} -1)  \\
        &= p^m - p^{m-1} = p^{m-1}(p-1) \\
        &= \varphi(p^{m}) \\
        \end{aligned}
        $$
