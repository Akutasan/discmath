# Countability

Countability is a fundamental concept in set theory and mathematics that deals with the size and nature of sets. The idea that there are different kinds of *infinities* can be quite counterintuitive at first. However, understanding these distinctions is crucial. It helpor uns us determine whether a set is finite, countably infinite, countably infinite, providing insight into concepts like **discrete** and **continuous** (after all this course is called **discrete** mathematics). This understanding significantly influences how we can classify and think about different problems, particularly in computer science.

**Definition 3.42**: 
1. Two sets $A$ and $B$ are **equinumerous**, denoted $A \sim B$, if there exists a bijection $A \to B$.
2. The set $B$ **dominates** the set $A$, denotes $A \preccurlyeq B$, if $A \sim C$ for some subset $C \subseteq B$ or, equivalently if there exists an injective function $A \to B$.
3. A set $A$ is called **countable** if $f : A \preccurlyeq \mathbb{N}$, and **uncountable** otherwise.

The central aspect of this chapter is to decide whether a given set $A$ is countable or uncountable. More precisly you need to find an injection/bijection $\mathbb{N} \to A$ or find some other way to show that there is none.
