# About
 

## Purpose of this website
The content of this website is not intended to replace the [official script](https://crypto.ethz.ch/teaching/DM24/ln/DM24_LN.pdf) in any way. Instead, we aim to provide supplementary ideas, tips, and resources to enhance the conventional methods of studying for this course. **Our goal is to offer an additional perspective.**

We encourage students to use this content alongside the official script to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. By integrating these resources, students can benefit from diverse explanations and approaches, ultimately leading to a deeper and more well-rounded comprehension of the course topics. Whether you are looking for clarification on specific concepts or seeking new study strategies, this supplementary material is designed to support your learning journey.
