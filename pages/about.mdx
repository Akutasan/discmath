# About
 

## Purpose of this website
The content of this website is not intended to replace the [official script](https://crypto.ethz.ch/teaching/DM24/ln/DM24_LN.pdf) in any way. Instead, we aim to provide supplementary ideas, tips, and resources to enhance the conventional methods of studying for this course. **Our goal is to offer an additional perspective.**

We encourage students to use this content alongside the official script. Whether you are looking for clarification on specific concepts or seeking new study strategies, this supplementary material is designed to support your learning journey.
